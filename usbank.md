# US BANK ACCESS PROCESS 

The purspose of creating an Access database for US Bank, is to improve upon the work management that is needed to build the required "data set" for US Bank. Currently the billing rep is working on average 2.5 hours of "data scrum" to meet the standards of the client. However, with the amount of meticulous detail that is needed to confirm that the data is accurate is not an ideal scenario to put the billing representative in.
